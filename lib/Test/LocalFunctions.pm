=head1 NAME

Test::LocalFunctions - Detects unused local functions


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::LocalFunctions version 0.21


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # check modules that are listed in MANIFEST
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;
    all_local_functions_ok();
    done_testing;

    # you can specify modules to ignore the test
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;
    all_local_functions_ok({ignore_modules => ['Wanna::Ignore::Module']}); # Wanna::Ignore::Module will be ignored to testing
    done_testing;

    # you can also specify individual file
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;
    local_functions_ok('/path/to/your/module_or_script');
    done_testing;

    # you can specify functions to exclude from test by regex.
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;
    local_functions_ok('/path/to/your/module_or_script', {ignore_functions => [qr/_wanna_ignore_function/]}); # _wanna_ignore_function() will be ignored to testing.
    # all_local_functions_ok({ignore_functions => [qr/_wanna_ignore_function/]}); # <= also ok!
    done_testing;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::LocalFunctions finds unused local functions to clean up the source code.
(Local function means the function which name starts from underscore.)

This module decides back end module automatically. If `Compiler::Lexer` has been
installed in target environment, this module will use `Test::LocalFunctions::Fast` as back end.
Otherwise this module will use `Test::LocalFunctions::PPI`. Which uses `PPI` for lexical analysis.

`PPI` is not fast, but `Compiler::Lexer` is fast.
So I recommend you to install `Compiler::Lexer`.


=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item * all_local_functions_ok

This is a test function which finds unused variables from modules that are listed in MANIFEST file.

=item * local_functions_ok

This is a test function which finds unused variables from specified source code.
This function requires an argument which is the path to source file.

=item * which_backend_is_used

This function returns the used module as back end.
It will returns `Test::LocalFunctions::PPI` or `Test::LocalFunctions::Fast`.

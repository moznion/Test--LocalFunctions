# NAME

Test::LocalFunctions - Detects unused local functions



# VERSION

This document describes Test::LocalFunctions version 0.13



# SYNOPSIS

    # check modules that are listed in MANIFEST
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;

    all_local_functions_ok();
    done_testing;

    # you can also specify individual file
    use Test::LocalFunctions;
    use Test::More;

    local_functions_ok('/path/to/your/module_or_script');
    done_testing;



# DESCRIPTION

Test::LocalFunctions finds unused local functions to clean up the source code.
(Local function means the function which name starts from underscore.)

This module decides back end module automatically. If \`Compiler::Lexer\` has been
installed in target environment, this module will use \`Test::LocalFunctions::Fast\` as back end.
Otherwise this module will use \`Test::LocalFunctions::PPI\`. Which uses \`PPI\` for lexical analysis.

\`PPI\` is not fast, but \`Compiler::Lexer\` is fast.
So I recommend you to install \`Compiler::Lexer\`.



# METHODS

- all\_local\_functions\_ok

    This is a test function which finds unused variables from modules that are listed in MANIFEST file.

- local\_functions\_ok

    This is a test function which finds unused variables from specified source code.
    This function requires an argument which is the path to source file.

- which\_backend\_is\_used

    This function returns the used module as back end.
    It will returns \`Test::LocalFunctions::PPI\` or \`Test::LocalFunctions::Fast\`.
